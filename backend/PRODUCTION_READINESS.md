# Production Readiness Checklist for Mainnet-Beta

## üî¥ CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Mainnet

### 1. RPC Endpoint Configuration
- [ ] Sign up for premium RPC provider (Helius recommended)
- [ ] Update `.env.production` with RPC endpoint
- [ ] Test RPC connection and rate limits
- [ ] Configure fallback RPC endpoints

### 2. Program IDs & Addresses
- [ ] Deploy contracts to mainnet-beta
- [ ] Update `FACTORY_PROGRAM_ID` in `.env.production`
- [ ] Update `MANAGER_PROGRAM_ID` in `.env.production`
- [ ] Update `TREASURY_WALLET` with mainnet address
- [ ] Verify all program IDs are correct

### 3. Security & Secrets Management
- [ ] Generate new `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` for production (NEVER reuse dev key)
- [ ] Store encryption key in AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] Set up AWS KMS for key management
- [ ] Configure IAM roles with least privilege
- [ ] Never commit `.env.production` to git
- [ ] Add `.env.production` to `.gitignore`

### 4. API Keys
- [ ] Get Gemini API key: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- [ ] Configure API key rotation policy
- [ ] Set up rate limiting for API usage

### 5. Database
- [ ] Set up production PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Supabase, or Neon)
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS for database connections
- [ ] Set up automated backups (daily minimum)
- [ ] Configure connection pooling

- [ ] Test stop loss triggers
- [ ] Test position size limits (5% max)
- [ ] Verify slippage protection (0.5%)
- [ ] Test price impact limits (1% max)
- [ ] Verify minimum liquidity requirements ($50k)

### 8. Trading Engine Tests
- [ ] Test swap execution on mainnet with small amounts
- [ ] Verify Jupiter integration works on mainnet
- [ ] Test transaction confirmation logic
- [ ] Verify commission tracking
- [ ] Test error handling and retries

- [ ] Test concurrent trade limits

### 9. Infrastructure
- [ ] Deploy to production environment (AWS, GCP, or similar)
- [ ] Set up load balancer
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domain
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules

### 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable connection pooling
- [ ] Configure Redis for caching (optional)
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Set up CDN for price feeds
- [ ] Configure compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket connections

## üü¢ NICE TO HAVE - Post-Launch Improvements

### 11. Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement advanced order types
- [ ] Add multi-sig support for large trades

### 12. Compliance & Legal
- [ ] Review regulatory requirements

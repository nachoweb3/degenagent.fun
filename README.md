## ⚡ QUICK START

### View the Live UI
```bash
# Open in browser
http://localhost:3002
```

**Services Running:**
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3002
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Executor: Ready to start

### Test Locally
```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"ok","network":"devnet","blockHeight":<number>}
```

## 🤖 WHAT IS AGENT.FUN?

Agent.fun is a revolutionary platform that enables anyone to create and deploy **autonomous AI trading agents** on the Solana blockchain.

### Key Features
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Trading**: Google Gemini Pro analyzes markets and makes intelligent decisions
- ⚡ **Fully Autonomous**: Agents operate 24/7 without manual intervention
- 🔒 **Secure & Transparent**: All trades executed on-chain
- 💰 **Tokenized Ownership**: Each agent has its own SPL token
- 📈 **Revenue Sharing**: Token holders earn from agent profits
- 📱 **Mobile-Ready**: Optimized for Solana Saga

### How It Works
1. **Create**: Launch your AI agent for 0.5 SOL
2. **Fund**: Deposit SOL into the agent's vault
3. **Trade**: AI analyzes markets every 5 minutes and executes trades
4. **Earn**: 1% platform fee, rest goes to token holders

## 💰 DEPLOYMENT TO MAINNET

### Costs

| Item | Cost (SOL) | Cost (USD @ $100/SOL) |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| Deploy agent-factory | 3-5 SOL | $300-500 |
| Deploy agent-manager | 8-12 SOL | $800-1,200 |
| Testing & fees | 1-2 SOL | $100-200 |
| Buffer for errors | 3-5 SOL | $300-500 |
| **TOTAL** | **15-25 SOL** | **$1,500-2,500** |

**Recommended**: Fund wallet with 20-25 SOL for safe deployment

### Deployment Process

**Automated script available** (`./scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh`)

```bash
# 1. Install tools (one-time)
# - Solana CLI
# - Anchor Framework

# 2. Fund deployment wallet
# Transfer 20-25 SOL to deployment wallet

# 3. Run deployment
./scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh

# 4. Initialize factory
ts-node scripts/initialize-mainnet.ts

# 5. Verify
./scripts/verify-mainnet.sh
```

**Total time**: 45-60 minutes

### Assisted Deployment Available

I can handle the entire deployment process for you:
- Compile programs
- Deploy to mainnet
- Initialize factory
- Test with first agent
- Configure all services

**Requirements:**
- 20-25 SOL in a wallet
- Access to wallet (temporary or screen share)
- 1 hour of your time

See `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for full details.

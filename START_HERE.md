## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ALREADY DONE

1. ‚úÖ **Frontend deployed** to Vercel (https://degenagent.fun)
2. ‚úÖ **Backend compiled** and ready
3. ‚úÖ **Environment variables** configured for DEVNET
4. ‚úÖ **Railway CLI** installed
5. ‚úÖ **Deployment scripts** created

## üéØ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (3 SIMPLE STEPS)

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

**Double-click this file:**
```
DEPLOY_RAILWAY_SCRIPT.bat
```

This script will:
- Log you into Railway (opens browser)
- Initialize Railway project
- Deploy your backend
- Configure all environment variables
- Give you the backend URL

**IMPORTANT:** After it finishes, copy the URL it shows (something like `https://xxx.railway.app`)

---

### Step 2: Update Frontend with New Backend URL (2 minutes)

**Double-click this file:**
```
DEPLOY_UPDATE_FRONTEND.bat
```

When it asks, paste the Railway URL you copied from Step 1.

This script will:
- Update Vercel environment variables
- Redeploy frontend with new backend URL

---

### Step 3: Test Everything (5 minutes)

1. **Get devnet SOL:**
   - Go to: https://faucet.solana.com/
   - Enter your wallet address
   - Request 2 SOL

2. **Test agent creation:**
   - Open: https://degenagent.fun/create
   - Connect your wallet (make sure it's on devnet)
   - Fill out the form
   - Click "Launch Agent"
   - Sign the transaction

3. **Verify:**
   - Agent should be created successfully
   - Check transaction on Solana Explorer (devnet)

## ‚ö° QUICK START (Copy & Paste)

If you prefer manual commands, open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# 1. Deploy backend
cd C:\Users\Usuario\Desktop\Agent.fun\backend
railway login
railway init
railway up

# 2. Set variables (after login and init)
railway variables set RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.devnet.solana.com
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=3001
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://degenagent.fun,https://www.degenagent.fun
railway variables set TREASURY_WALLET=46hYFV39fxucRsidrE1qffXNXiZykX8yG9qNnmeia3ez
railway variables set ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS=46hYFV39fxucRsidrE1qffXNXiZykX8yG9qNnmeia3ez
railway variables set ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=10f52181f531fd093e5f9a9b38e634e4dac2c4f11e6186532a275c316d7b32a3
railway variables set ENCRYPTION_KEY=10f52181f531fd093e5f9a9b38e634e4dac2c4f11e6186532a275c316d7b32a3
railway variables set FACTORY_PROGRAM_ID=Factory11111111111111111111111111111111111
railway variables set MANAGER_PROGRAM_ID=Manager11111111111111111111111111111111111
railway variables set COMMISSION_RATE=0.5
railway variables set REFERRAL_COMMISSION_RATE=10
railway variables set MIN_TRADE_FOR_COMMISSION=10

# 3. Get URL
railway domain

# 4. Update frontend (replace <URL> with your Railway URL)
cd ..\frontend
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API production --yes
echo "<YOUR_RAILWAY_URL>/api" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API production
vercel --prod
```

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After deployment:

- [ ] Railway backend is deployed and running
- [ ] Backend URL obtained from `railway domain`
- [ ] Frontend updated with new backend URL
- [ ] Frontend redeployed to Vercel
- [ ] Health check works: `curl <BACKEND_URL>/health`
- [ ] Frontend opens without errors
- [ ] Wallet connects successfully
- [ ] Agent creation works on devnet

---

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### "railway: command not found"
- Railway CLI installed but not in PATH
- Restart your terminal/PowerShell
- Or run: `npm install -g @railway/cli` again

### "Cannot login in non-interactive mode"
- Use the `.bat` script files instead
- They will open your browser for login

### "CORS error" in browser
- Make sure ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes your domain
- Check Railway variables with: `railway variables`

### Backend not responding
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify PORT=3001 is set
- Check all env variables are configured
